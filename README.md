# Jarvis Voice Assistant 🤖🎤

Welcome to the **Jarvis Voice Assistant** project! This is a personal assistant built using Python and various libraries that lets you interact with your computer through voice commands. From getting weather updates 🌦️ to controlling apps like Spotify 🎶, Gmail 📧, and more, Jarvis is here to help you manage your tasks with ease.

## Features 🚀

- **Voice Commands** 🎙️: Interact with your system using your voice.
- **Weather Information** 🌦️: Get the latest weather updates for any city using OpenWeather API.
- **Web Search** 🔍: Ask Jarvis to search the web for you via Google or directly fetch answers from ChatGPT.
- **Control Applications** 🎵💻: Open applications like Notepad, Spotify, Gmail, WhatsApp, and more with voice commands.
- **Music Player** 🎶: Play your favorite songs on Spotify.
- **System Commands** 🖥️: Open system applications like File Explorer, Command Prompt, Microsoft Store, etc.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the backend.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts your voice commands into text.
- **pyttsx3**: A library to convert text into speech (text-to-speech).
- **OpenWeather API**: Fetches real-time weather data.
- **OpenAI GPT**: Provides intelligent responses for "what is" and "who is" queries.
- **Web Browser Automation**: Opens websites like Google, YouTube, Gmail, and more.
- **Spotify API**: Play and control music on Spotify.

## Prerequisites 📋

1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your machine. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install the required libraries** using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 requests openai webbrowser

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-voice-assistant.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
API Keys Setup:

Obtain an API key for OpenWeather from OpenWeather and paste it in the OPENWEATHER_API_KEY variable in the code.
Get an OpenAI API key from OpenAI and paste it in the openai.api_key variable in the code.
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
python jarvis.py
Jarvis will greet you and start listening for commands. 🎙️

How It Works 🧠
Jarvis listens to your voice commands using the Speech Recognition library. Once you speak a command, it’s converted into text, and Jarvis processes the command to perform the requested action. Here’s how it works:

Voice Input 🎤: Jarvis listens to your voice via the microphone using the speech_recognition library.
Speech to Text 📜: The voice input is converted into text using Google’s speech recognition API.
Command Execution ⚡: Based on the recognized command, Jarvis performs actions like:
Opening applications (e.g., YouTube, Gmail, Spotify).
Providing weather updates using OpenWeather API.
Searching the web via Google or fetching answers from OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
Response Output 🗣️: After processing the command, Jarvis responds back with either text-to-speech using pyttsx3 or opens the required application/website.
Here are some Sample Commands Jarvis can process:

"What is the weather in [city]?" 🌦️
"Open YouTube" 📺
"Play a song on Spotify" 🎵
"Search for [topic]" 🔍
"Who is [name]?" 🤖
"Open File Explorer" 💻
Example of Jarvis in Action:
User says: "What is the weather in New York?"

Jarvis responds: "The weather in New York is clear with a temperature of 15°C."
User says: "Open Spotify and play music."

Jarvis opens: The Spotify app and starts playing music.
User says: "Who is Albert Einstein?"

Jarvis responds: "Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity."
